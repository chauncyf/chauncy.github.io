`Why R U Soooo Nervous`

Luckily, after the career fair, I received an online technical interview from TripAdvisor (actually I'm the only one among my classmates). It's a great company that makes people's life easier, I really appreciate the opportunity.

The interviewer is a Senior Principle Software Engineer... (Ok fine, the interviewer from MatrixCare is the Architect)

The interview process is pretty straightforward. Firstly, the interviewer introduced the company, the tech stack (Micro Services, Java, Node.js, React (Native?), GraphQL, etc.. fascinating).
Ask me question about the company (Organization of teams, size of team). Then comes to the coding part (didn't asked me to introduce myself..).

Question was really simple.. Intersect of three array. I don't know why I'm so nervous.. I was thinking about sort them first.. I used a set at last.
Follow up was required to use constant space. Three pointer.
