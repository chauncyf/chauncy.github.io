Extra / Goose House

Space between the words and key with nothing to unbare  
Pictures taken long ago  
Forgotten umbrellas  
Expired tickets, broken glasses, shoes that fit no more  
Dream I couldn't make it true  
Memories of past  

I'm an extra  
Don't pass me by  
You know what I mean  
Same to you  
In this apathetic world  
Each of us are extras with hopes unshed  

Cork of empty bottle, all those edges they cut off  
Present I never sent to you  
Throwaway cameras  
Vault without the treasure and the attic to be spared  
Forgotten penny on the chest  
Trophies with dust  

I'm an extra  
Don't pass me by  
You know what I mean  
Same to you  
In this apathetic world  
Each of us are extras with hopes unshed  

I'm an extra  
Don't pass me by  
You know what I mean  
Same to you  
In this apathetic world  
Each of us are extras with hopes unshed
