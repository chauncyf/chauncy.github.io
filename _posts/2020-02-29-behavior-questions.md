## Leadership Principles
> We use our Leadership Principles every day, whether we're discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on the best approach to solving a problem. It is just one of the things that makes Amazon peculiar.

1. **Customer Obsession**  
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
2. **Ownership**  
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."
3. **Invent and Simplify**  
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
4. **Are Right, A Lot**  
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
5. **Learn and Be Curious**  
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
6. **Hire and Develop the Best**  
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
7. **Insist on the Highest Standards**  
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
8. **Think Big**  
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
9. **Bias for Action**  
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 
10. **Frugality**  
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
11. **Earn Trust**  
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
12. **Dive Deep**  
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
13. **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**  
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
14. **Deliver Results**  
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.



## Self Introduction
### Tell me about yourself
I’m currently a Master’s student in Computer Science at Brandeis University, where I am focusing on Software Engineering, and I've took several related courses. 

For example, *Capstone Project for Software Engineering*, which told me how to build a complete product from stratch, like database schema design, backend server implement, and frontend design, etc. By the way, I'm the Teaching Assistant for this coures right now.

Of course this is not enough for a good software engineer, so I've taken another course called *Software Engineering for Scalability*. This course focuses on the scalability problem in software engineering, and tought me how to improve a product to make it able to support millions of users. I learned a lot from this course, like database partitioning, like using Redis to cache frequently queried data and avoid unnecessary database access, also like using RabbitMQ to implement an asynchronized work queue to do some resourse intensive job.

Before that, I worked for MatrixCare as a Software Engineer Intern and I worked on a major release of an Electronic Health Record software. During the internship, I helped refactored the application architecture from Java EE model to Spring model, which inculdes code change, JDK update, and bugs fix.

Now that I’m finishing my Master’s degree, I’d love to focus on software engineering and discover the opportunity to work for Amazom AWS. 

### Tell me about your internship
Last summer, I had an internship in MatrixCare, which is a company that provides one stop software solution in the seniors living market, like Electronic Health Record.

As a Software Engineer Intern, I worked in a special team that directly led by our architect. The goal of our team was to update the architecture of company's flagship software. So I helped refactured the architecture from Java EE model to Spring model, changed application container from JBoss to Tomcat, also updated JDK from 7 to 12.

**Challenge**  
Because the most important task was to refactor the old stack to a new stack, and the old stack was used like more than 10 years ago, so of course I dont really understand them.

In order to do the work, I have to read a lot of documents of the old stack first, and when I dont understant or I cannot find a doc, I will go to my manager to collegues for help.

The refactor went pretty well, I helped updated several important stuff like database management service as well.

`TODO`

## Why xxx
### Amazon
Because I know Amazon is a top internet retailing company with a strong focus on customer experience. And there are a lot of talented people in amazon creating amazing products to make people’s life easier. 

Actually I have a roomate work at amazon, and he always showes a strong ownership to his projects and he always wants to make things perfect. This really touches my heart and reminds me of the time when I was working on the Workout TeampUp social networking applicaiton, I spent days and nights to polish the UI simply because I want to give a perfect user experience.

I believe I have similar spirits with Amazon, that one of the biggest reason why I want to join Amazon.

## Deadline / Time management
### What if you can’t make the deadline  
During my internship at MatrixCare, I was once given one week to update the logging framework from log4j to log4j2. I believe I could handle this because it didn’t sound that complicate, so I accepted. But it turned out that I was not that familiar with the product and underestimated the amount of work I have to do. 

When I realized that the deadline was fast approaching, I explained the situation to my manager and asked for an extension, which he granted. 

Finally I met the second deadline, and I learned that I need to be honest with myself about the workload I can handle. I also learned that when accepting assignments, I need to include extra time to ensure even there is a roadblock, I can still meet the deadline.

### Handle multiple task at same time
During my internship at Matrixcare, since we are wollowing the agile development process, we have bi-weekly sprint to list tasks that we have to do in the following 2 weeks. So for myself, I have a TODO list to list all tasks assigned to me from most important to least important, and finish them one by one. Beside the TOOD list, I also uses a calendar app to help me scheduled, because there are meetings, appointments, etc. in the daily work. So that I will never miss an important event. 


## Mistake
### Netagive feedback from teammate
- Tell me about a time when you were wrong
  
When I was working on the Workout TeamUp project with other two teammates, one of the teammates complained to me that I was always working alone and didn't paying enough attention to the team. 

This happened because it's a course project, it's new to all of us, and I have to learn how to do it. I enjoy the process to solve problems by myself, because I found it satisfying, so I rarely discuss with my teammates about any obstacles. 

After the teammate's complain, I realized that I have to make more communication with the team. so we decide to have daily short meetings to talk about any roadblocks, and share experiences with each other. 

It's only a short meeting, but we found that it clearly improved the whole team's efficiency.



`updating logging framework, go back and forth`

I'm passionate about learing new stuff, but maybe I'm too passionate and sometime this lead to trouble

### Cannot make the commitment
**Ref to deadline**


##  Ownership
> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

### Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
***ref to tight deadline***

- Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
  


## Insist on the Highest Standards
> Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

### Tell me about a time when [you, team member] couldn’t meet your expectations on a project.
***ref to tight deadline***



## Customer Obsession  
> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

### Who was your most difficult customer?
Honestly say, I dont have a rich experience work with real "customers" yet, but since I'm doing a TA for the Capstone course, I do have a lot of experience with my student customers.

One of the most important duty for being a TA is to answer students' questions. And once I had a student having trouble with an assignment, it's a really hard one, and he didn't know how to start with it. Definitely I can't do the assignment for him, so gave him some helpful materials to look at, and suggested him with a possible approach to do it. 

I emailed him the second day to see if he was still having trouble with it, and he says that my suggestion was really helpful and he finished the assignment.


- Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectations. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
- When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?



## Are Right, A Lot
> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

### Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.
`TODO` fix the front end 

During my internship at MatrixCare, I was given a task to fix a front-end bug caused by the update of container. 


## Hire and Develop the Best
> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

### Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.
***ref to difficult customer***



## Deliver Results
> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

- By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments. Describe the results.
- What is the most difficult situation you have faced in your life? How did you handle it?
- Give me an example of a time when you were 75% of the way through a project, and you had to pivot strategy–how were you able to make that into a success story?

`TODO` handle multiple task at a time, tight schedule


## Bias for Action
> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

- Describe a time when you saw some problems and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
- Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.
- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
`TODO` 


## Dive Deep

- Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.
- Tell me about something that you learned recently in your role.


## Invent and Simplify

- Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.
- How do you stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, or innovate in your work?


## Think Big
> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

- Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.
- Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.


## Frugality
> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

- Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.


## Earn Trust
